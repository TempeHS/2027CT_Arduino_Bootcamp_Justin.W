  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn how to wire two motors to an H-Bridge controller and
  control the motor's speed and direction.

  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand what an H-Bridge is and what it does
    2.  I can fit the shield correctly to the Arduino
    2.  I can manually write different directions and speeds to two motors
    3.  I understand the advantages and disadvantages of a continuous servo over a motor and H bridge
    4.  Understand the importance of only connecting an external battery when the Arduino is disconnected from the computer
